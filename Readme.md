Explanation of the Routes
Root Route (GET /):

A basic route to test tracing with simple spans and events.
Query Parameter Route (GET /user):

Accepts query parameters like ?name=John and adds them as attributes to the span.
POST Route (POST /user):

Accepts JSON data in the body and logs it as an attribute for the span.
Path Parameter Route (GET /user/:id):

Demonstrates how to trace requests with path parameters, adding the parameter (id) as an attribute.
Data Processing Simulation (POST /process):

Simulates a more complex workflow, where input data is processed, and events are logged during the process.
How to Explore
Trigger Routes:

Use tools like Postman, cURL, or a browser to send requests to these routes.
Example:
bash
```js
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:4040/user?name=Alice'
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4040/user' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Bob"}'
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:4040/user/123'
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4040/process' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"task":"ProcessData"}'
```
Observe in Jaeger:

Open the Jaeger dashboard (default at http://localhost:16686).
Search for traces using the service name defined in your tracing.js.
Explore the spans, attributes, and events for each route.
Modify and Experiment:

Add more routes, simulate longer tasks, or introduce errors to learn how they appear in traces.
